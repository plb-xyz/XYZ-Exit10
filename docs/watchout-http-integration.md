# Watchout 7 HTTP Integration — Node-RED (v0.2)

## Overview

This integration connects Dataton Watchout 7 with Node-RED via the Watchout HTTP
API. Everything runs directly inside Node-RED nodes — no external JavaScript
modules are required.

Persistence uses two JSON files:

- `watchout-config.json` — host, port, and file paths
- `timeline-mapping.json` — the active `contentId → { displayName, watchoutId }` mapping

**Default port:** `3019`

> **Note (v0.2):** Watchout supports real-time monitoring via **NDJSON**
> (`GET /v1/ndjson`) and **SSE** (`GET /v1/sse`). In some Docker/Windows +
> Node-RED environments, long-lived streaming endpoints may not work reliably
> with the built-in **HTTP Request** node (requests can remain open until they
> time out). This flow therefore supports:
>
> - **Polling** via `GET /v0/state` (reliable)
> - Optional streaming (NDJSON/SSE) where supported
> - A recommended pattern to **poll immediately after sending a control command**
>   (so UI updates quickly even without streaming)

## File Structure

```
node-red/
├── flows/
│   └── watchout-v2.json          ← Self-contained Node-RED flow (importable) ← USE THIS
├── config/
│   └── watchout-config.json      ← Config template (copy to /config/ in Docker)
└── data/
    └── .gitkeep                  ← Runtime-generated mapping goes here (or /data/)
```

> In Docker the recommended mounts are:
> - host `node-red/config` → container `/config` (config file)
> - host `node-red/data`   → container `/data`   (mapping file)

---

## Installation

### 1. Import the flow

In Node-RED, go to **Menu → Import → Clipboard** and paste the contents of
`node-red/flows/watchout-v2.json`.

### 2. Set the config file path

The startup inject node fires once on deploy with a default path of
`/config/watchout-config.json`. Edit the inject node payload if you
want to store the config elsewhere.

### 3. Create / edit the config file

Copy `node-red/config/watchout-config.json` to `/config/watchout-config.json`
(or wherever you pointed the inject) and edit it:

```json
{
  "host": "192.168.1.10",
  "port": 3019,
  "mappingFile": "/data/timeline-mapping.json"
}
```

If the file does not exist the flow will create it with defaults on first deploy.

> **Docker users:** `/config` and `/data` are paths **inside the container**.
> Add bind-mounts (or named volumes) to your `docker run` / Compose file so
> these directories are persisted on the host:
>
> ```yaml
> volumes:
>   - ./node-red/config:/config   # holds watchout-config.json
>   - ./node-red/data:/data       # holds timeline-mapping.json
> ```

### 4. Required Node-RED nodes

The flow requires only the built-in Node-RED nodes and the Dashboard:

| Package | Nodes used |
|---------|-----------|
| `node-red` (built-in) | inject, function, switch, http in, http request, http response, file in, file out, catch, debug |
| `@flowfuse/node-red-dashboard` (Dashboard 2.0) | ui-page, ui-group, ui-button, ui-template |

Install the Dashboard package if not already present:

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install @flowfuse/node-red-dashboard
```

Restart Node-RED after installing.

> **Optional — SSE client:** If you prefer SSE over NDJSON, you may install
> `node-red-contrib-sse-client`. However, note that this contrib node does
> **not** allow overriding its configured URL via `msg.url` or similar message
> properties — the URL must be set directly in the node's configuration panel.

> **Docker on Windows — URL note:** Node-RED running inside a Docker container
> on Windows cannot reach `localhost` on the host. Use
> `http://host.docker.internal:3019/...` instead (Docker Desktop for Windows
> resolves this hostname to the host machine automatically). See
> [§ Docker on Windows Networking](#docker-on-windows-networking) below.

### 5. Deploy

Click **Deploy**. On startup the flow will:

1. Read `/config/watchout-config.json` (create with defaults if missing)
2. Read `/data/timeline-mapping.json` (start with empty mapping if missing)
3. Begin monitoring Watchout state via polling (`GET /v0/state`) and/or streaming where supported

---

## Docker on Windows Networking

When Node-RED runs inside a Docker container on a **Windows host** where
Watchout is also running, `localhost` inside the container refers to the
container itself — not the Windows host.

| Context | URL to use |
|---------|-----------|
| `curl` / browser on the Windows host | `http://localhost:3019/...` |
| Node-RED HTTP Request node (inside container) | `http://host.docker.internal:3019/...` |

`host.docker.internal` is automatically resolved to the Windows host by Docker
Desktop. Use this hostname in all Node-RED node URL fields and config files.

**Example config (`watchout-config.json`) for Docker on Windows:**

```json
{
  "host": "host.docker.internal",
  "port": 3019,
  "mappingFile": "/data/timeline-mapping.json"
}
```

## Manual Timeline Discovery Workflow

```
Operator opens Node-RED dashboard → "Watchout" tab

1.  Operator clicks  [ Re-discover Timelines]
        │
        ▼
2.  Node-RED calls  GET /v0/timelines  from Watchout (port 3019)
        │
        ▼
3.  Response parsed → new contentId → { displayName, watchoutId } mapping built
        │
        ▼
4.  New mapping compared to stored mapping
        │
        ├─ REMOVED  : "Timeline 'show_1' no longer exists"
        ├─ ADDED    : "New timeline 'show_3' discovered"
        ├─ CHANGED  : "Timeline 'ambience_1' ID has changed"
        └─ OK       : "show_2"
        │
        ▼
5.  Diff UI displayed
        │
        ├─ [ Cancel]          → pending mapping cleared, nothing saved
        └─ [ Confirm & Save]  → mapping written to flow context
                                  + written to timeline-mapping.json
                                    via Node-RED Write file node
```

## Timeline Name → Content ID Convention

Watchout timeline names are converted to **content IDs** using these rules:

| Rule | Example input | Output |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Names starting with `_` are skipped | `_SystemClock` | *(ignored)* |
| Trimmed and lower-cased | `Show 1` | `show_1` |
| Spaces → underscores | `Ambience Scene 2` | `ambience_scene_2` |
| Non-alphanumeric chars removed | `Show (Main)` | `show_main` |

Each discovered timeline produces one entry in the mapping:

```json
{
  "show_1":    { "displayName": "Show 1",    "watchoutId": "1" },
  "ambience_1": { "displayName": "Ambience 1", "watchoutId": "3" }
}
```

- **`contentId`** — normalized key used in Node-RED messages (e.g. `"show_1"`)
- **`displayName`** — original Watchout timeline name; used for UI labels
- **`watchoutId`** — numeric timeline ID used in Watchout REST calls

---

## Control API (Node-RED)

Send a `POST` request to `/watchout/control` with a JSON body. The
**Prepare control request** function node maps these commands to Watchout REST endpoints.

### Timelines

Start a timeline:
```json
{ "command": "start", "contentId": "show_1" }
```
→ `POST /v0/play/{id}`

Stop a timeline:
```json
{ "command": "stop", "contentId": "show_1" }
```
→ `POST /v0/stop/{id}`

Pause a timeline:
```json
{ "command": "pause", "contentId": "show_1" }
```
→ `POST /v0/pause/{id}`

Play all timelines:
```json
{ "command": "playAll" }
```
→ `POST /v0/play`

Get current state:
```json
{ "command": "getState" }
```
→ `GET /v0/state`

### Inputs (Variables)

Set a single input:
```json
{ "command": "setVar", "varName": "masterVolume", "varValue": 50 }
```
→ `POST /v0/input/{key}?value={v}`

Set multiple inputs (bulk / fades):
```json
{
  "command": "setVars",
  "vars": [
    { "key": "masterVolume", "value": 50, "duration": 1000 },
    { "key": "Content", "value": 10 }
  ]
}
```
→ `POST /v0/inputs` with JSON array body `[{key, value, duration?}]`

### Cue Sets (Cue Group State)

Get states by ID:
```json
{ "command": "getCueGroupStatesById" }
```
→ `GET /v0/cue-group-state/by-id`

Get states by Name:
```json
{ "command": "getCueGroupStatesByName" }
```
→ `GET /v0/cue-group-state/by-name`

Switch single variant by ID:
```json
{ "command": "setCueGroupVariantById", "groupId": "12", "variantId": "2" }
```
→ `POST /v0/cue-group-state/by-id/<groupId>/<variantId>`

Switch single variant by Name:
```json
{ "command": "setCueGroupVariantByName", "groupName": "Atrium 1 Mode", "variantName": "Show" }
```
→ `POST /v0/cue-group-state/by-name/<groupName>/<variantName>`

Switch multiple variants by ID:
```json
{ "command": "setCueGroupVariantsById", "states": { "12": "2", "13": "1" } }
```
→ `POST /v0/cue-group-state/by-id` with JSON body `{ "groupId1": "variantId1", ... }`

Switch multiple variants by Name:
```json
{ "command": "setCueGroupVariantsByName", "states": { "Atrium 1 Mode": "Show", "Atrium 2 Mode": "Ambient" } }
```
→ `POST /v0/cue-group-state/by-name` with JSON body `{ "groupName1": "variantName1", ... }`

Reset all cue groups to default:
```json
{ "command": "setCueGroupVariantsByName", "states": {} }
```
→ `POST /v0/cue-group-state/by-name` with JSON body `{}`

### Response shape

The flow normalizes Watchout responses into a uniform JSON structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "command": "start",
  "contentId": "show_1",
  "displayName": "Show 1",
  "timelineId": "1",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": {}
}
```

Cue group commands will include cue-related fields when available:
- `groupId`, `variantId`
- `groupName`, `variantName`
- `states` (for multi-switch/reset)

## Flow Context Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `watchout_config` | object | `{ host, port, mappingFile }` |
| `watchout_mapping` | object | Active `{ contentId: { displayName, watchoutId } }` mapping |
| `watchout_pending` | object | Pending mapping awaiting operator confirmation |
| `watchout_state` | object | Latest state from polling and/or streaming |
| `watchout_sse_status` | string | `'connected'` \| `'disconnected'` \| `'error'` |

---

## Monitoring / State Updates

### Polling (`GET /v0/state`)

Polling is the most reliable approach across Docker/Windows environments.

A common pattern is:

- poll every 5 seconds, and
- after sending any command, wait ~200–500 ms and then poll once immediately (one-shot refresh)

This provides fast dashboard updates even when streaming endpoints are unavailable.

### Streaming (NDJSON / SSE) (optional)

Watchout provides:

- `GET /v1/ndjson` — NDJSON stream (each line is `{"kind":...,"value":...}`)
- `GET /v1/sse` — SSE stream (each event is `data: {...}`)

Depending on Node-RED version and environment, you may need a streaming-capable client
(contrib SSE client or a custom node) rather than the default HTTP Request node.
